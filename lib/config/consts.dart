💁‍♀️ <b>Help</b>

The game is about guessing a five letter word. You will have 6 tries to guess the word.
After each guess, you will get a hint about how many letters are in the word and how many are correct. 

Examples: 
Guess: WORLD
Hint: 🟩 ⬛️ ⬛️ ⬛️ ⬛️

Here W is correct, and no other letters are in the word. 

Guess: OPENS
Hint: 🟩 🟨 🟩 ⬛️ ⬛️

In this, O and E are in the word and at correct position, P is in the word but on a different position, but not in the correct position.

🔔 <b>New Word & Notifications</b>
A new word will be available every day. The bot will send you notification when the word is available. You can handle notification preference by sending /notify command.
